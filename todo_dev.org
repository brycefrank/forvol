    CLOSED: [2018-01-01 Mon 10:48]
    
 - After these are done it will be ok to push to master
*** TODO Create some test data using NVEL
** A Random To-Do List
*** Maintenance & Improvements
**** TODO [#C] Fix "AK_SECN" coefficient tables
     - Tricky / improper formatting
**** TODO [#B] Working equations lists needs formatting 
     - It would be nice if [[https://github.com/brycefrank/forvol/wiki/Supported-Equations:-CVTS][this list]] was more of a table type thing
     - This would require editing bin/supported.R
**** TODO [#B] Convert all csv's to rda
**** TODO [#A] More tests!
***** TODO Calc_vol alignment check
      - Check that when calc_vol is called on a dataframe, that the vector
        returned by calc_vol is correctly aligned with the original sample data
      - This could be done by for-looping through the dataframe and calculating
        the volume via each record, then comparing equal to 
*** New Features
**** TODO [#B] Implement sofarchivetwood merchantable volume equations
***** TODO [#B] Implement cv4 equations

      - This will need either really long function definitions, or the ability
        to call other functions from the stored function string. The second
        option seems do-able and would clean the csv's up quite a bit.
        
        The problem is that I need to access the original input region and spcd
        to fully identify the equation in the first place... (i.e. to get the
        correct coefficients).
        
        Got something working (on laptop forvol_dev/pupulate_with_funcs.R). It
        looks like I am able to build equations within function strings pretty
        easily. The next step is to figure out what is appropriate w/r/t notation
        and keeping functions readable.
**** TODO Create forvol-specific citations csv
** Ideas
*** Advanced usage methods
**** Equation builder
     - Allow user to retrieve equation strings (see equation forms idea below)
     - Allow user to easily input their own coefficients
*** Equation forms csv
    - It is now clear that each ID from the FIA spreadsheets does not strictly correspond
      to an equation form, that said it will eventually be necessary to create key value
      pairs for equation forms and the functions themselves. This will be much simpler
      and cleaner, but will require a lot of work to reorganize and name them (ideally
      they will be named after the ciations)
