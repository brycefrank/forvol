** Next Master Update Checklist
*** TODO Implement some cv4, tarif, and sv632 equations (DF, WH, RC at least)
**** TODO Test these (informally / formally)
*** TODO Write test for generalized build_equations function
*** TODO Re-do sample with new changes
*** TODO Change calc_cvts to calc_vol OR refactor calc_cvts to work with build_eq
    
 - After these are done it will be ok to push to master
** A Random To-Do List
*** Maintenance & Improvements
**** TODO [#C] Fix "AK_SECN" coefficient tables
     - Tricky / improper formatting
**** TODO [#B] Working equations lists needs formatting 
     - It would be nice if [[https://github.com/brycefrank/forvol/wiki/Supported-Equations:-CVTS][this list]] was more of a table type thing
     - This would require editing bin/supported.R
**** TODO [#B] Convert all csv's to rda
**** DONE [#A] Improve Jupyter sample
     CLOSED: [2017-12-27 Wed 19:49]
**** TODO [#A] More tests!
*** New Features
**** TODO [#B] Implement softwood merchantable volume equations
***** TODO [#B] Implement cv4 equations
***** <2017-12-28 Thu> 
      - This will need either really long function definitions, or the ability
        to call other functions from the stored function string. The second
        option seems do-able and would clean the csv's up quite a bit.
        
        The problem is that I need to access the original input region and spcd
        to fully identify the equation in the first place... (i.e. to get the
        correct coefficients).
        
        Got something working (on laptop forvol_dev/pupulate_with_funcs.R). It
        looks like I am able to build equations within function strings pretty
        easily. The next step is to figure out what is appropriate w/r/t notation
        and keeping functions readable.
**** TODO Create forvol-specific citations csv
