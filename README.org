* forvol

forvol is a package that contains various equations used to calculate the volume 
of trees using equations implemented by the Forest Inventory and Analysis program 
under the United States Forest Service. The main objective of this project is to
provide a free and open source high level package in R for interacting with and testing the performance
of taper, biomass and volume equations, while functioning as a suitable equation
library to be used by other programs (such as forest inventory compilers and
merchandizers).

** Standard Notation

To function properly, forvol requires that some standardized notation be met:

- Diameter at breast height - dbh
- Total height of the tree - ht
